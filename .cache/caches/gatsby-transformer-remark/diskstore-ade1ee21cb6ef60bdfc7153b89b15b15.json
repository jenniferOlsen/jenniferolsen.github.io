So I built this app to feed me a random photo as a drawing prompt. I made it as a progressive web app so I could save it to my MacBook dock and my phone homescreen.</p>\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app\">Create React App</a> to get up and running quickly and <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a> to make deployment a breeze. </p>\n<p>To test it out for yourself, connect your Dropbox account and add some photos to the <code>Apps/Reference Engine</code> folder which will be automatically created. </p>"}
