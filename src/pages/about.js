      In 2012, I gave up bookselling to work on the world’s greatest library,
      better known as the web. I fell in love with problem solving, learning new
      things, and of course HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

      My passion is writing clear, maintainable CSS and I'm currently studying
      design, user experience, and accessibility. Recently, I’ve been primarily
      using React, but I love learning new frameworks and languages and believe
      in using the best tool for the job (and the team).

      I have a lot of experience bringing a site from idea to deployment, and
      doing rapid feature development while juggling multiple deadlines all
      within an agile(-ish) environment. My time working in agencies proved I
      can do it all (front end, back end, native apps, acting as lead, and
      managing deployment). My time as a freelancer showed that I thrive in an
      environment that allows me a great deal of indepence. But I do my best
      work when part of a highly-collaborative, cross-functional team, and I’m
      passionate about building beautiful products that work well for everybody.
      Ultimately, I’m driven by the potential usefulness of my work and derive
      meaning from the degree to which I can help people.
