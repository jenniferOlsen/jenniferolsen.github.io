Progressive web app built with React and the Dropbox API. 

I made a goal to do some drawing everyday, but found it hard to figure out what to draw somedays. So I built this app to feed me a random photo as a drawing prompt. I made it as a progressive web app so I could save it to my MacBook dock and my phone homescreen.

I used <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">Create React App</a> to get up and running quickly and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to make deployment a breeze. 

To test it out for yourself, connect your Dropbox account and add some photos to the `Apps/Reference Engine` folder which will be automatically created.
