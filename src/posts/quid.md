Satirical match-three game built with React and Firebase.

Built with [Benjamin Herson](http://bherson.com) and a few other friends as a fun way to gain experience building React web apps, Quid is a match-three game about political corruption. My primary contributions were in DevOps (setting up our firebase integration and DNS) and CSS.
