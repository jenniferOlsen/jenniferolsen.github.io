Tiny Tarot is a stand-alone app for Apple Watch, Fitbit, WearOS, and Samsung smartwatches. I did all development and design for this project, including custom artwork and card text. This project was a labor of love and I was determined to make this app available on all smartwatch platforms.  

I had never done any real design work before, so the most challenging part of this project was desiging a user interface that worked well with less than 300px of screen space. After that, I needed to learn enough Kotlin and Swift to build the WearOS and Apple Watch versions. Luckily, Fitbit and Samsung use web tech so I was more in my comfort zone there.
