Tiny Tarot is a stand-alone app for the Fitbit Ionic and Versa smartwatches. I did all development and design for this project, including custom artwork and card text. 

The Fitbit SDK uses JavaScript, CSS, and SVG, which are all very familiar technologies for me. So the most challenging part of this project was desiging a user interface that worked well with less than 300px of screen space.
