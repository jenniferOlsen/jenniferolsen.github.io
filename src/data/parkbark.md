A local dog owner and designer was frustrated by the current state of dog park apps. Even Google lacked the information that dog owners need when deciding where to take their pet. So she decided to make her own and came to the team at Hello World Devs for development.

React Native allowed us to build the app quickly and under-budget, as well as set the project up for eventual release on iOS in addition to Android. Drupal 8 let us immediately set up an admin portion of the site for entering information about local dog parks, and then easily export the data as a REST resource for our app to consume.
    
As the senior dev on the project, I took on building the Drupal backend and making sure GET and POST requests between Drupal and React Native worked correctly.
